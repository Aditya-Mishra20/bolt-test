# bolt-test
In this project, I explored the use of Bolts.new, an AI tool that helped me quickly build an e-commerce website with just a few well-crafted prompts. The experience was mind-blowing and demonstrated how AI can accelerate the development process. However, it also highlighted the importance of having a strong foundation in coding to fully leverage these tools.
